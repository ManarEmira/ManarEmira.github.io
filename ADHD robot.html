                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <h4>Robot Chassis and Inner Parts</h4>
       				<p>The chassis of the robot serves as its skeleton, so it is essential to have a well-designed and well-assembled one. The success or failure of the robot can depend 
                        on the chassis that’s why we chose to work on a wheeled chassis type which will 
                        be more suitable in our project. It is designed to hold most of the electric components such as: 
                        microcontrollers, motors, wheels, etc. it is also designed to connect the external 
                        body covers to it so it can be installed and uninstalled, it is important to uninstall 
                        the parts in case any damaged happened inside the body either if it was a burnt 
                        component or a wiring problem. The chassis itself can be divided into two parts 
                        which are the upper and lower parts.</p>

                       <p>There are some aspects to consider. The structural metal components assemble much easier when 
                        90 and 45 degrees connections are used. The chassis shape should allow 
                        space for the robot’s other components such as the control system, battery, motors, and wheels. A 
                        good design practice is to lay out the chassis with all of the other components before the assembly 
                        to assure the spacing will work.Aluminum square tube 25x25x1mm is use as the type of 
                        structural metal pieces that is used to assemble the chassis where its properties make 
                        it widely used for designs in robotic competitions as it will be further explained in 
                        the fabrication.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Stress Analysis and  Factor of Safety (FOS)</h4>
                        <p>Structural stress analysis is performed in order to ensure that a structure will fulfill 
                            its intended function in a given loads environment. It is important to anticipate all 
                            the possible failure modes and design against them. Stress is the measure of an 
                            external force acting over the cross-sectional area of an object. Stress has units of 
                            force per area: N/m2
                            (SI) or lb. /in2
                            (US). The SI units are commonly referred to as 
                            Pascals, abbreviated Pa. There are two types of stress that a structure can experience: 
                            1. Normal Stress and 2. Shear Stress. When a force acts perpendicular (or "normal") 
                            to the surface of an object, it exerts a normal stress. When a force acts parallel to the 
                            surface of an object, it exerts a shear stress.
                            In our project we subjected the chassis to a load that reaches to 196N (20Kg) in 
                            lower bars and 98N (10Kg) in upper bar then started to calculate the stress analysis </p>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/gallery/ADHD 4.gif" alt=""> 
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Each material has an ultimate stress a 
                                measure of how much stress the material can withstand before failing. To properly 
                                design a safe structure, we need to ensure that the applied stress from the external 
                                loading never exceeds the ultimate stress of the material. Part of the difficulty with
                                this task is that we don't always know exactly what the external load is it may vary 
                                unpredictably, and the structure may have to withstand unexpectedly high loads. To 
                                account for this uncertainty, we incorporate a Factor of Safety into our design. The 
                                factor of safety is just a ratio of the failure load or stress to the allowable load or 
                                stress. The failure or ultimate value is a material property while the allowable value 
                                is determined by the external force and the geometry of the structure.only a linear displacement is happening to the chassis, so we are in the 
                                safe zone and to make sure of that we calculated the minimum factor of safety (FOS) = 1.5 so it means our 
                                structure can be safely manufactured to hold loads up to 392N (40Kg).

                                <p>In the real world, a servo motor’s axis is the blue nail. This is the robotic arm’s joint. 
                                    The orange bar is the link of a robotic arm. The force F is the force acting on an 
                                    object (that the robotic arm is trying to lift) due to gravity as shown

                                <h4>Robotic Arms Assembly</h4>
                                <p>Links of robotic arms won’t need to hold heavy objects so its preferable to make 
                                    these links as light as possible but also with strength not to break and the best option 
                                    in this case is using wooden plates to form links as wood is a bad conductor of 
                                    electricity so if any electric leakage happened it won’t reach to the connected motors 
                                    and damage them. The robotic arm has 3 DOF which is divided into 2 for the 
                                    shoulder to allow it to move freely and 1 for the elbow</p>

                                    <p>Simply said, robotics is the combination of technology, science, art, and engineering 
                                        that produces devices or robots that can behave like people. Many current human 
                                        jobs will be replaced by machines or automation as technology advances. Our kids 
                                        are more likely to benefit from early exposure to robotics concepts. This discipline 
                                        helps kids develop a variety of soft skills, including critical thinking, problem solving, programming, creativity, communication, and others because of its 
                                        interdisciplinary character</p>

                                                <p>The chosen material for the body covers is Fiberglass which is a highly versatile 
                                                    lightweight material that is often used as a durable and cost-effective alternative to 
                                                    wood, and metal. The robotic arm covers are designed to be detachable and 
                                                    installable incase any damage happened to the servo motors so it can be easy to

                                    <p>The upper body is designed so it can hold the touchscreen, ultrasonic sensor, and 
                                        raspberry pi camera, and a rectangular cut is made at the top of the body to allow the 
                                        servo to reach to the head and allow it to move, it’s also designed in a certain way 
                                        so it can be attached to the lower body of the robot and a circular slot with 100mm 
                                        diameter that allow both arms to be attached to the body</p>
                                        <p>The lower body is designed to be attached with the upper part of the body as 
                                            mentioned, it consists of two unmovable legs that has another female / male 
                                            connection when the car placed beneath it, it is then connected to the upper body using the female / male 
                                            connections and both are mounted to the chassis</p>
                                            <p>The car is designed to allow the robot movement in all directions using four wheels 
                                                with only two motorized rear wheels, the car body is designed to cover these 
                                                components, the fours wheels are hidden inside the design and 4*2 circular slots are 
                                                cut for the ultrasonic sensors in all direction allowing the car to avoid all obstacles</p>
